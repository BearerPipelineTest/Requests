Getting Support
===============
I'm always happy to answer support questions about Requests. There's a bunch of
ways to get in contact with me:

* **Twitter**: Send a tweet with your question to
  [@rmccue](http://twitter.com/rmccue), if you can fit it into a single tweet.

* **Email**: You can always email me personally if you have a longer question.
  My email address is [available via my site](http://ryanmccue.info/).

If you think you've found a problem in Requests, please
[file an issue on GitHub]({{ site.github.issues_url }}) rather than
contacting me.
